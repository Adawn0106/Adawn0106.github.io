I recently participated in the KOSPO competition hosted by Korea Southern Power.
The problems were more diverse than I expected and not too difficult, so it was great to be able to try all of them, even though I couldn't solve many.

1. APK (Bonus 1) 

When I downloaded the problem, I received a file like this.

To understand how the APK functions, I ran it using Nox.

This screen appeared, but I couldn’t find any other meaningful information.

I proceeded to analyze the APK further using Jadx.

During the analysis with Jadx, I found a hint in the BuildConfig file.

```bash
public static final String kospo_hint = "CN+C+OU+ST+L+O=Base64";
```

This value seemed to suggest that the fields needed to be concatenated and then converted to Base64.

After researching with GPT, I found out what this information meant.

In an APK file, "CN+C+OU+ST+L+O=Base64" generally represents the subject information from the certificate used to sign the APK. Each field provides details about the issuer or owner of the certificate, following the X.509 standard.

The fields indicate the following information:

CN (Common Name): Typically refers to the name of the issuer or domain.
C (Country Name): Represents the country code (e.g., KR for Korea, US for the United States).
OU (Organizational Unit): Refers to the department within the organization.
ST (State or Province Name): The name of the state or province.
L (Locality Name): The name of the city or locality.
O (Organization Name): The name of the organization or company.
This string is Base64-encoded, meaning it was converted from its original form to prevent data corruption during transmission. Base64 encoding converts binary data into text.

Thus, "CN+C+OU+ST+L+O=Base64" refers to the certificate's subject information that has been Base64-encoded.

By examining this information, I identified the following certificate details:

```bash
CN=U21hc, OU=5lcmd, O=l9MaWZl, L=dHRlc, ST=5X0Jl, C=nRfRW
```

These values seemed odd, so I concatenated them in the appropriate order:

```bash
U21hcnRfRW5lcmd5X0JldHRlcl9MaWZl
```

After obtaining this string, I used Cyberchef to decode it from Base64.

```bash
Smart_Energy_Better_Life
```
