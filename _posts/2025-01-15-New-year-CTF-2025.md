I wrote a write-up for the CTF I recently participated in.

Since I've been juggling a lot of things lately, I could only focus on solving problems that could be completed within an hour.

It's a simple write-up so I don't think there's much to see.

For the ones I couldn't solve, I'll try to post their write-ups later.

This is a welcome problem, and the contents are as follows.

This CTF uses Telegram as its main community and Discord as its second community. 

Etc.. and flag were listed, so I entered the flag.

This problem is a simple overflow problem, and the source code is as follows.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    char buffer[32];
    printf("Give me some data: \n");
    fflush(stdout);
    fgets(buffer, 64, stdin);
    printf("You entered %s\n", buffer);
    fflush(stdout);
    return 0;
}
```

If you look, the current buffer itself has a size of 32, but since it receives input as 64, you can see that overflow is occurring.

At this time, I was wondering where to get the flag, but looking at the problem comment, I thought I could just cause a break, so I proceeded as is.

If you download this question, you can see that it is in pdf format. 

So, at first I tried extracting with binwalk, but nothing really happened. lol

Since it was a Beginner problem, I thought it would be simpler, so I looked into it further.

In this way, I was able to see the highlighting on the picture.

The picture below was also the same.

haedang sajin-eul bomyeon symbol of the sun-eulo nawaissda 

geulaeseo jeongdab-eun sun-ida.
If you look at the photo, it appears as a symbol of the sun. 

So the correct answer is sun.

This picture is given, and if you create the corresponding QR and take a picture, a flag will appear.

 

So, if you create the same QR code in the link below and take a picture of it with a camera, a flag will be printed.

If you look at the downloaded file in the problem as hxd, you can get the bytes.
It is a simple problem that can be solved by making the inverse function of the function shown in the source code for the bytes.

```
def rev001(flag):
    return ''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])
```

If the letters look strange and you see the first one as you, just change the same letters. 

So I changed it 

It became grodno{you_go_on_for_a_way_at_crypto}. 

I guess it's wrong, I tried but got hit...

It seemed similar to problem number 1 I solved earlier, but it felt like a lot of photos had been added, so I tried deleting the photos. 

Found flag.

Actually, the problem itself is simple. 

However, it was a very frustrating problem. 

Number 9 was so poor that it felt like brute force.

Ha... I found the correct answer by going to the link on Wikipedia and entering my last name.

This is the same type of problem!

I was a bit stuck on the Lazarus group's 2014 attack problem... but somehow I solved it.

When I search endlessly, two poet names come up like that, and when I put the poet's name in front of them, it gets verified and I solve them all.
