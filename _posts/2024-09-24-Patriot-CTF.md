While browsing the CTFtime website, I decided to participate in the Patriot CTF. 
To be honest, I didnâ€™t have much confidence since the previous CTF challenges I attempted were quite difficult, and I struggled to solve them.
However, after starting the Patriot CTF, my perspective changed.
The problems were not as hard as I expected, and I was able to challenge myself.
There was a wider variety of problems than I thought, making it more enjoyable, and it turned out to be a great experience for someone like me who has just started studying. 
Although I didn't make it into the top 100 this time, I will work harder and prepare better so I can rank within the top 100 next time.
