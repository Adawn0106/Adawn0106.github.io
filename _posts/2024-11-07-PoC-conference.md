I first learned about the PoC Conference at a hacking camp, where I was awarded the “Diligent Hacker” prize and received a ticket to the PoC Conference as part of the prize.
Thanks to that, I attended the PoC Conference for the first time this year. Whenever I read blog posts or listen to people who’ve attended PoC Conferences, I often hear them mention the need to study English, and now I completely understand why.

At this year’s PoC Conference, there were several presentations on V8. 
Although I couldn’t fully understand everything due to my limited English, the presentations were clearly high-level and incredibly interesting. 
That’s probably why I felt it was such a shame not to be able to fully grasp everything, and it motivated me to study English even more!

I don’t have extensive knowledge or much experience researching V8 yet, but attending the conference reignited my motivation to work harder.
The speakers were so impressive that I started imagining that maybe someday, if I keep improving my English and research a lot about V8, I might be able to present as well.
There’s still a long way to go, but the idea inspires me.

Next time, I’d love to make some foreign friends to practice English conversation and maybe even discuss topics about different countries—it sounds like it would be fun and also improve my English skills. 
Overall, it was a valuable experience.
