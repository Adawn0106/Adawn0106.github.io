Last weekend, I participated in the Intigriti-CTF-2024, and it was really fun because there were so many problems of various types.
Iâ€™d like to take some time to review the challenges I solved and the ones I attempted during the competition.

The first category is the warmup. Since the scores were low, I thought I would solve them easily, but they turned out to be not that straightforward.


## Warm Up

### Sanity Check

This challenge was a simple one. Clicking the link redirected to the competition's Discord server.
By checking the Discord channel, the flag could be found, making it an easy and straightforward challenge.
